===================
DONE
===================

Add new cache components & tb base
and then make it "work" (lol)

make lots of tb for cache, use an axi ext cocotb + axi translator

make an axi arbitrer, less etricate tb but still some bs axi translator

add mem_read that we didn't had before (adapt & retest control unit)
integrate new logic block (mem deprecated, replace by) + add signals + arbitrer
TB:
make a test harness environement
find a way to init an external memory

adapt tb to wait on cache stall
adapt tb signals assertion for new test harness

add more holy tests for cache misses

===================
DOING
===================



===================
NOT DONE
===================

figure our this tlast bug once and for all, use new arbitrer tb to check vanilla interactions

integrate all in pytest, make all the deisng coherent and run flawlessly

make things lot cleaner

AXI wresp & rresp error handling.

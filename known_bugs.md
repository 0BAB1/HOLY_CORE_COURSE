- on FPGA : when reseting the core ONLY (not the peripherals) and realeasing the reset again, we core gets stuck @PC = 0 (all range being uncachebale when bug occured). The cache stays stucks @ state = sending read req (after transitionning form IDLE), without EVER rising ARVALID or touching the axi lite master if at all. a peripherals rest whille cpu reset is help helps recovering normal funtion but is not a normal utilisation flow...

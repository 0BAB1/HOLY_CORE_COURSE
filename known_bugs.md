- on FPGA : when reseting the core ONLY (not the peripherals) and realeasing the reset again, we core gets stuck @PC = 0 (all range being uncachebale when bug occured). The cache stays stucks @ state = sending read req (after transitionning form IDLE), without EVER rising ARVALID or touching the axi lite master if at all. a peripherals rest whille cpu reset is help helps recovering normal funtion but is not a normal utilisation flow...

- potential bug : excpetion (in control) is set to 0 by default if cache is not valid to prevent raising "illegal" when instruction cache may be spitting bullshit. exception is fored to 1 in case of some exception so even if the cache is not valid, an exception might be raised if the residual instrction is "ecall" for example. **This should not be a problem** as the cache would stall until it fectches a valid instruction anyway but edge cases *might* arrise as this smells like a reciepe for disaster, even though real problem nver really showed up yet.

adding new instructions quote : https://youtu.be/z6qxMFgNEM4?feature=shared&t=35

testing 1 main program is cool and all but should make some more rovusts test benches fr the cpu, 
or at least save the state (CPU & MEMORY) before each clock cycle and compare against to really isolate our changes.

i'd like to do so much with this afterwards ! like actually use it for so many project i have in mind ! I feel like a 60-70's researcher trying to unlock the "computing power" thing in the tech tree haha.


UPDATE THE CONTROL TESTS IN THE TUTORIAL : THEY LACK NEW INPUT RESET !

Also apply new input reset method for ALU testbenches !

create a test setup explanatory md file.

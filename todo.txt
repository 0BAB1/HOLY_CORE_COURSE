Add new cache components & tb base
and then make it "work" (lol)
make lots of tb for cache, use an axi ext cocotb + axi translator
make an axi arbitrer, less etricate tb but still some bs axi translator
add mem_read that we didn't had before (adapt & retest control unit)
integrate new logic block (mem deprecated, replace by) + add signals + arbitrer
TB:
make a test harness environement
find a way to init an external memory
adapt tb to wait on cache stall
adapt tb signals assertion for new test harness
add more holy tests for cache misses
integrate all in pytest, make all the deisng coherent and run flawlessly

adding new instructions quote : https://youtu.be/z6qxMFgNEM4?feature=shared&t=35

testing 1 main program is cool and all but should make some more rovusts test benches fr the cpu, 
or at least save the state (CPU & MEMORY) before each clock cycle and compare against to really isolate our changes.

UPDATE THE CONTROL TESTS IN THE TUTORIAL : THEY LACK NEW INPUT RESET !(done) 
Also apply new input reset method for ALU testbenches ! (not done)

9.1.b : add a default case to hadle unsupported f7

Make the setup file including all the simulation details, (normal & CPU ROM files).

include also details on dfferents simulations and how to include packages for verilator

And than startworking on the PDF for supporters (do the same for the AI tutorials)

onc RV32I is finished, freeze the last design schemes and do cover.
